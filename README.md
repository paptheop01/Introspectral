Looking for a place to gracefully track your daily routine, tasks, habits and more? Introspectral is the place to be. Start tracking your life effectively with Introspectral today!

## About this app

Introspectral is here to guide you through your daily routine, tasks, habits and more. Be sure to  explore all the different features of this app and make 100% use of them.

- Boost your productivity : Set your priorities and organize your  tasks with Introspectral using a daily tasklist. You can insert, delete new tasks throughout the day and also quickly track their progress.

- Improve your daily routine: Add  the new positive habits that you want to establish  in the habit list or add goals for the bad habits that you want to limit. (To be frank if an app is needed to remind you to drink water you should probably look into that but until then weâ€™re more than happy to help!)

- Some positive reinforcement: Check your all time statistics and unlock new achievements as you improve your life and become the better version of yourself. 

- Journaling : Use photos, voice messages as well as a vast list of emojis to write down your daily experiences and track your mood. You can reflect upon those notes later in the future.
